Checking alphabets in a string, the best way is ASCII. Each character on keyboard has an encoding between 0 and 127.
Alphabets can be filtered out from other symbols using their ASCII code and vice versa


Intuition: Use ASCII, make a note of the characters between 91-96 aka between 'Z' and 'a'


What I learned:
1. How to utilize ASCII code for numbers, alphabets, etc.
2. Handling exceptional cases as in the case of empty string
