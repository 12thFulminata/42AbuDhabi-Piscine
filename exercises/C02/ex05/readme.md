Similar program compared to lowercase where we use ASCII.
Checking only upper case alphabets in a string, the best way is ASCII. Each character on keyboard has an encoding between 0 and 127 which is called as ASCII.
Upper case alphabets can be filtered out from other symbols using their ASCII code and vice versa


Intuition: Use ASCII, very simple implementation of ASCII range 65 to 90


What I learned:
1. ASCII comparisons are quick and efficient way to distinguish between alphabets
2. Importance of avoiding unnecessary checks, equivalent of 'break' statement in python which saves a lot of computing resources and time
