Convert all letters to lowercase, except the first letter of every word.
Intuition: Best way would be to 
            1. Convert everything to lowercase first
            2. Cycle through the string by checking the first word
                -Can be done by looking at the previous character 
                -Or by checking prev one not alphanumeral


What I learned:
1. Detecting new words using puntuations of breaks and spaces.
2. Easy capitalization using indexing of words to get the first leter.
