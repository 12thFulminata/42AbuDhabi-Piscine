String Operations Summary:




In this project, I learned:


1. Importance of ASCII and how easy it is to manipulate entire strings using ASCII
2. How ASCII can be used to convert one charater into another, eg lower and uppercase
3. Different types of copy functions inbuilt in C - strcpy, strlcpy, stncpy
4. Learned how to identify different characters based on ASCII


How to run:

Have gcc installed.

Type in terminal the following -

1. gcc ft_strcpy.c -o ft_strcpy
(where ft_strcpy.c is the name of the file and the last ft_strcpy is the name of the output file)

2. ./ft_strcpy
