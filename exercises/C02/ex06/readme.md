Similar program as the previous ones where we use ASCII.
Checking only printable characters in a string, the best way is ASCII. Each character on keyboard has an encoding between 0 and 127 which is called as ASCII.
printable characters can be filtered out from other symbols using their ASCII code and vice versa


Intuition: Use ASCII, very simple implementation of ASCII range 32 to 126


What I learned:
1. ASCII is an easy way to filter out entire sets of characters from numbers and alphabets
2. Avoid unnecessary checks if one case is found saves a lot of processing time and resources and should be practised.
