Intuition : Count number of characters in src, add dest to the end, finally add a null pointer
Very similar to strcat, only one addition, add condition for n letters. Program copied from strcat one

What I learned:
1. Resuing concepts, very important, saves time and effort
2. Boundary control and how to avoid overflows
