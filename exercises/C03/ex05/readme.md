Intuition : If buffer size is less, no space left, keep that in mind and create a separate loop

What I learned:
1. Replicating and resuing code which saves a lot of time. Modifying it to fit a different program and requirement.
2. Avoid overflows by keeping buffer sizes in mind as most of the times, string operations like concat could result in overflows as the buffer might not be big enough
