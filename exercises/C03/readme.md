String Manipulation Summary

In this project, I learned :
1. Essential string functions in C like concat, compare etc
2. Importance of the ASCII characters which includes ASCII comparisons. ASCII comparisons are an easy alternative which is preferred over manual comparisons of letters
3. Ways to implement different functions and operations on strings.
4. Essential knowledge on pointers and functions.
5. Importance of proper indexing as nested loops and indexing could get tricky at times if not done with care.
6. Importance of handling exception cases like in the case of a null string passed


How to run:
1. Have gcc installed.
2. Type in terminal the following -

   gcc ft_strcmp.c -o ft_strcmp
   (where ft_strcpm.c is the name of the file and the last ft_strcmp is the name of the output file)

   ./ft_strcmp
